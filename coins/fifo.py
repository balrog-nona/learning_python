This script introduces one of the methods how to calculate tax
out of revenue from selling crypto currencies.

Method:
FIFO - first in first out
- cost of sales for a sale is calculated against the price of the earliest purchase.
If this purchase isn't large enough to cover the sale, the rest of the sale
is calculated against the price of the second purchase and so on until all
sales of the year are matched with corresponding purchase's price.
- revenue for a sale is derived from the actual selling price
- profit/loss is defined by the difference between revenues and costs of sales

    This function calculates the total profit/loss of the year.
    First, it calculates sales revenue for every sale of the year.
    Then, it calculates cost of sales using purchase history. Cost of sales is calculated
    against the price of the earliest purchase. If this purchase doesn't have enough
    quantity to cover the sale, the remaining quantity of the sale is calculated against
    next purchase's price and so on until the total quantity of the sale is matched with
    corresponding purchase's price.
    After using all the quantity of a purchase for calculating cost of sales completely,
    the purchase is removed from list of purchases and the second purchase takes the
    first place in the list and its quantity will be used for calculation.
